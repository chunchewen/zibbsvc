# zibbsvc
A Bayesian Zero-Inflated Spatially Varying Coefficients Model for Overdispersed Binomial Data

Authors: Chun-Che Wen, Rajib Paul, Kelly Hunt, James O'Malley, Hong Li, Elizabeth Hill, Angela Malek, Brian Neelon

This repository includes three folders: Simulation, Synthetic, and SC Info.

The Simulation folder contains the R code to simulate the Zero-Inflated Beta-Binomial Spatially Varying Coefficient (ZIBB-SVC) model (Simulation-ZIBBSVC.R), as described in the Simulation section. We export the MCMC samples for each parameter as an R data file (Simulatio-MCMCSampler.Rda) for use in generating plots. In the Make Plot.R script, we import the MCMC samples from Simulation-ZIBBSVC.Rda and generate the plots presented in the manuscript and supplementary material.

The Synthetic folder contains the synthetic version of the South Carolina (SC) prenatal data to facilitate analysis. The actual SC prenatal data cannot be shared due to the policies of the SC Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, Health and Demographics Section, and the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control. This folder includes synthetic data (xxxx.Rda) and run the ZIBB-SVC model (Synthetic-ZIBBSVC.R).... 

Note: The SC_SVI.csv file contains the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) for each county in South Carolina, and SC_adj.csv is the 46 Ã— 46 adjacency matrix for SC. Both files are included in the SC Info folder.

# Folder

## Simulation
 - Simulation-ZIBBSVC.R: Generates simulation data using the MCMC algorithm, calculates WAIC, and creates trace plots.

 - Simulation-MCMCSampler.Rda: Contains the MCMC samples from the Simulation-ZIBBSVC.R script.

 - Make Plot.R: Creates plots for the manuscript.

## Synthetic 
 - Synthetic-CRF-Data.Rda: Synthetic version of the South Carolina (SC) prenatal data.

 - Synthetic-ZIBBSVC.R Fit ZIBB-SVC model to the synthetic dataset

 - Synthetic-MCMCSample.Rda: Contains the MCMC samples from the Synthetic-ZIBBSVC.R script.   

## SC Info

  - SC_SVI.csv: Percentile-based SVI data for each SC county.

 - SC_adj.csv: South Carolina adjacency matrix.
